## Server template
There are 2 ways of opening and executing databases. One for SQLite and other for PostgreSQL choose which ever you like better.

For PostgreSQL you can add admin user using specific flags.
Add with flags admin user ```go run server.go -username=[username] -password=[password] -email=[email@email]```

By default it is set to SQLite


## Usage
- Open terminal
- Navigate to ./server and run ```go run server.go```
- Server should be now running on ```http://localhost:8080/```
